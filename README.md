# **ZENEVENT** is a service for booking places for events. <p>This is my **first** small project in which I used my meager frontend combined with some backend skills.</p>

## The website is running on port ":8080". I ask you to understand my project, because my knowledge of the server side is quite modest. <p><p>**In the near future**, I will try to supplement the code with something, as well as carry out refactoring.</p></p>
```
The entry point to the program is `cmd/main.go`

Just run this file and log in to ``localhost:8080`` ;)
